## Introduction to pour over

The pour-over method is a manual brewing technique that requires you to pour hot water over freshly ground coffee placed in a filter. This method gives you full control over the brewing process, allowing you to adjust variables such as water temperature, pour speed, and extraction time. As a result, it’s a favorite among coffee enthusiasts for its precision and ability to extract delicate flavors from the coffee beans.

## How pour over is made

Making pour-over coffee is simple, but it does require some attention to detail to ensure the best results. Here's how you can brew a cup of pour-over coffee:

1. **Grinding the coffee**: Use a medium grind for pour-over brewing. It should be similar in texture to granulated sugar, allowing for even extraction.
2. **Boiling the water**: Heat your water to around 200°F (93°C), just off the boil, to avoid scalding the coffee grounds.
3. **Preparing the filter**: Place your coffee filter in the dripper and rinse it with hot water to remove any paper taste and preheat your equipment.
4. **Brewing**: Add the ground coffee to the filter, then slowly pour the hot water over the grounds in a circular motion, starting from the center and working outward. Allow the coffee to bloom for about 30 seconds before continuing to pour water in small, even circles.
5. **Serving**: After the water has filtered through the coffee grounds, your brew is ready. Pour the coffee into your cup and enjoy!

## Characteristics of pour over coffee

Pour-over coffee is known for its clean, smooth, and bright flavor profile. Because the method uses a filter, it removes most of the oils and sediments from the coffee, leaving a clear cup with a crisp taste. This brewing style allows the subtle flavors of the coffee to shine, making it a perfect choice for single-origin beans.

## Brewing time

The brewing time for pour-over coffee is typically around 3 to 4 minutes. This gives you enough time for the water to fully extract the flavors from the coffee grounds, resulting in a flavorful and aromatic cup.

## Conclusion

Pour-over coffee is a method that puts the power of brewing in your hands, allowing you to control the entire process. With its clean and crisp flavors, it’s a favorite among coffee purists who enjoy the art of brewing. Whether you're new to coffee or a seasoned enthusiast, the pour-over method is a great way to explore the depths of your coffee beans.
