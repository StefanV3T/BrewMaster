**Time:** 4 mins  
**Difficulty:** Medium

## Ingredients:
- Medium ground coffee
- Hot water
- Filter

## Instructions:
1. Place a filter in your pour-over cone and rinse it with hot water to remove any paper taste.
2. Add the medium ground coffee to the filter (about 1-2 tablespoons per cup).
3. Slowly pour hot water over the coffee grounds in a circular motion, starting from the center and moving outward. This helps to evenly saturate the grounds.
4. Allow the water to filter through the coffee slowly. This should take about 3-4 minutes in total.
5. Once the water has filtered through, remove the pour-over cone and enjoy your fresh cup of coffee!

Enjoy your pour-over coffee!
